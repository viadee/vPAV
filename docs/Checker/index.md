# Available Checkers

Consistency checks are performed by individual modules called checkers, which search for certain types of inconsistencies. All of these can be switched on
or off in the ruleset as required. Implementing further checkers is rather simple. Currently, the following checkers are implemented:

| Checker                                                                              | Summary                                                                  | Status       |
