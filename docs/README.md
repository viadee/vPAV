# viadee Process Application Validator (vPAV)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/de.viadee/viadeeProcessApplicationValidator/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/de.viadee/viadeeProcessApplicationValidator) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/viadee/vPAV.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/viadee/vPAV)

The tool checks Camunda projects for consistency and discovers errors in process-driven applications.
Called as JUnit test, it discovers esp. inconsistencies of a given BPMN model in the classpath and the sourcecode of an underlying java project, such as a delegate reference to a non-existing java class or a non-existing Spring bean.

Find a list of the consistency checks below.

We recommend to integrate the consistency check in your CI builds - you can't find these inconsistencies early enough.

We forked the [Camunda BPM examples](https://github.com/viadee/camunda-bpm-examples/) to demonstrate the easy integration of vPAV.

# Features

## Model-Code Inconsistencies and Checkers
Consistency checks are performed by individual modules called checkers, which search for certain types of inconsistencies. Currently, the following checkers are implemented: 

| Checker                                                                              | Summary                                                                  | Status       |

All of these can be switched on or off as required. Implementing further checkers is rather simple.
### Configuration
The viadee Process Application Validator comes with a default ruleSet.xml which provides some basic rules. In order to customize the plugin, we recommend creating your own ruleSet.xml and store it in **"src/test/resources"**. 
This allows you to use your own set of rules for naming conventions or to de-/activate certain checkers.

### One set of rules to rule them all
Furthermore you can use the plugin to manage multiple projects. Just create a blank maven project with only the parentRuleSet.xml stored in **"src/main/resources"** and run this project as maven install (make sure to package as jar). In your child projects you have to add the dependency to the parent project and to vPAV.

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>de.viadee</groupId>
	<artifactId>parent_config</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
	<groupId>de.viadee</groupId>
	<artifactId>viadeeProcessApplicationValidator</artifactId>
	<version>...</version>
</dependency>
```

The parentRuleSet.xml will provide a basic set of rules for all projects that "inherit". Local sets of rules will override inherited rules in order to allow for customization.

Make sure that inheritance is activated in the ruleSet.xml of your project.
```xml 
<rule>
	<name>HasParentRuleSet</name>
	<state>true</state>
</rule>
```
### Exclusion of false positives
An ignore file can be created to exclude false positives. The file has to be named **"ignoreIssues.txt"** and stored in **"src/test/resources"**. 
Here, you can list IDs of the issues which should be ignored in the next validation run. This must be done line by line. Line comments are initiated with "#".

Unique IDs are generated by a Message Digest. In the files **"bpmn_validation.json"** or **bpmn_validation.xml"**, you can find each issue attached to its respective ID. Additionally, if you open the modal by clicking an element with issues, the a modal with detailed information will be shown, also including the respective unique ID.  You can also directly whitelist an issue and then download your new ignoreIssues.txt file. This provides a convenient way to avoid copy & pasting your issues into your project.

![Issue Modal](img/issue_modal.png "Modal with additional information and unique issue ID")

**Example**
```
# Comment 
8d04f2e77a7d282c521098ab947ac060
```

### Multi-Language Support ###
As of version 2.5.0, we added localization for english and german users.

```xml
<rule>
	<name>language</name>		
	<settings>
		<setting name="locale">en</setting>
	</settings>
</rule>	
```
By specifying either **en** or **de** in the settings, you can choose to use either German or English as language for your visual output report. By leaving it blank, the validator grabs your systems locale and provides either German or English as default. 
Due to some refactoring, more languages can be added in the future by providing language files with the corresponding translations.


## Output

The result of the check is first of all a direct one: if at least one inconsistency is 
found on the ERROR level, it will break your build or count as a failed unit 
test which will break your build too.

Further, the consistency check will provide an XML version, a JSON version and
an visual version based on  [BPMN.io](https://bpmn.io/) of all errors and warnings found.

### Visual output
The header contains the name of the current model. Below the heading, you can select a different model of the project to be displayed.
You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel and move the model by click and hold.
In the BPMN model, the elements with errors are highlighted. Error categories are indicated by color. 
An overlay specifies the number of errors found on an element. Details can be seen by clicking on the overlay.
All errors are laid out in a table below the model. Clicking on the _rulename opens_ the corresponding documentation.
Clicking on the _Element-Id_ or _invalid sequenzflow_ marks the corresponding element(s) in the model.

To find the visual output, check the created vPAV folder inside your project's target folder. Open the **validationResult.html** with any browser to explore your process model and the found issues.

## Requirements
- JDK 8
- Camunda BPM Engine 7.4.0 and above

## Installation/Usage

### Maven
Add the dependency to your POM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>de.viadee</groupId>
  <artifactId>viadeeProcessApplicationValidator</artifactId>
  <version>...</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### JUnit
Configure a JUnit-4 Test to fire up your usual Spring context - esp. delegates referenced in the process, 
if you use Spring in your application or a simple test case otherwise to call the consistency check.

The recommended name for this class is ModelConsistencyTest, where you 
call the ProcessApplicationValidator by simply using code like the following:

```java
import de.viadee.bpm.vPAV.ProcessApplicationValidator;
...
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = { SpringTestConfig.class })
public class ModelConsistencyTest{
        
    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext ctx;   
    
    @Test
    public void validateModel() {
        assertTrue("Model inconsistency found. Please check target folder for validation output",
                ProcessApplicationValidator.findModelErrors(ctx).isEmpty());
    }
}

```
Note, that the Validator receives the Spring context. Thereby, the validation can
check delegate Beans and their names.


#### Methods
The `ctx` parameter is optional. If **no** Spring context is used, jUnit can also be started without the context parameter.

- `findModelErrors(ctx)` finds all model inconsistencies with **ERROR** status.

- `findModelInconsistencies(ctx)` finds **all** model inconsistencies (Error, Warning, Info).


#### SpringTestConfig

In order to evaluate beans in a Spring environment, you should specify a config class for your JUnit test

```java

import ServiceTaskOneDelegate;
import ServiceTaskTwoDelegate;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class SpringTestConfig {

    public SpringTestConfig() {
        MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this);
    }

    @InjectMocks
    private ServiceTaskOneDelegate serviceTaskOneDelegate;

    @InjectMocks
    private ServiceTaskTwoDelegate serviceTaskTwoDelegate;

    @Bean
    public ServiceTaskOneDelegate serviceTaskOneDelegate() {
        return serviceTaskOneDelegate;
    }

    @Bean
    public ServiceTaskTwoDelegate serviceTaskTwoDelegate() {
        return serviceTaskTwoDelegate;
    }

}
```
#### Add external checker 
You can also simply add your own checker. 
You can find an example project [here](https://github.com/viadee/vPAV_checker_plugin_example).
In your projects you have to add the dependency to the project with the checker-class(es) (see example below) and to vPAV ([see above](#maven)):

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>de.viadee</groupId>
	<artifactId>vPAV_checker_plugin_example</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
Run this project (e.g. vPAV_checker_plugin_example) as maven install (make sure to package as jar). 

The `setting name="external_Location"` defines the checker as an external checker.
The value specifies the location of the checkerclass.

```xml
<rule>
	<name>TaskNamingConventionCheckerExtern</name>
	<state>true</state>
	<settings>
		<setting name="external_Location">de.viadee.vPAV_checker_plugin_example</setting>
	</settings>
	<elementConventions>
		<elementConvention>
			<name>convention</name>
			<pattern>[A-ZÄÖÜ][a-zäöü\\\-\\\s]+</pattern>
		</elementConvention>
	</elementConventions>
</rule>
```
##### Requirements
- Your checker-class have to extends the *AbstractElementChecker*. 
- Only the parameters from the abstract class (`de.viadee.bpm.vPAV.config.model.Rule` and `de.viadee.bpm.vPAV.BPMNScanner`) are allowed in the constructor.

#### Checker instructions
You have to return a collection of `de.viadee.bpm.vPAV.processing.model.data.CheckerIssue`.

``` java
/**
* CheckerIssue
* 
* @param ruleName
*            Name of the Rule
* @param classification
*            Classification (Info, Warning or Error) of the rule
* @param bpmnFile
*            Path to the BPMNFile
* @param resourceFile
*            Path to resource file (e.g. dmn oder java)
* @param elementId
*            Id of the Element with issue
* @param elementName
*            Name of the Element with issue
* @param variable
*            Name of variable
* @param anomaly
*            Type of anomaly (DD, DU, UR)
* @param invalidPaths
*            Invalid path
* @param message
*            Issue message
*/
 ```
