# viadee Process Application Validator (vPAV)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/de.viadee/viadeeProcessApplicationValidator/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/de.viadee/viadeeProcessApplicationValidator) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/viadee/vPAV.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/viadee/vPAV)

The tool checks Camunda projects for consistency and discovers errors in process-driven applications.
Called as JUnit test, it discovers esp. inconsistencies of a given BPMN model in the classpath and the sourcecode of an underlying java project, such as a delegate reference to a non-existing java class or a non-existing Spring bean.

A list of the consistency checks can be found [here](Checker/index.md).

To get started with the viadee Process Application Validator read [Installation and Usage](https://viadee.github.io/vPAV/InstallationUsage.html) and [Output](https://viadee.github.io/vPAV/Output.html).
We forked the [Camunda BPM examples](https://github.com/viadee/camunda-bpm-examples/) to demonstrate the easy integration of vPAV.

We recommend to integrate the consistency check in your CI builds - you can't find these inconsistencies early enough.

## Release Notes
You can find our release notes over [here](https://github.com/viadee/vPAV/blob/development/docs/ReleaseNotes.md).

## Commitments
This library will remain under an open source licence indefinately.

We follow the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) scheme (2.0.0).

In the sense of semantic versioning, the resulting XML and JSON outputs are the _only public API_ provided here. 
We will keep these as stable as possible, in order to enable users to analyse and integrate results into the toolsets of their choice.

## Cooperation
Feel free to report issues, questions, ideas or patches. We are looking forward to it.
